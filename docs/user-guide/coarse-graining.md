# Coarse-Graining

Coarse-graining maps an atomistic structure onto a smaller set of beads. In
MolScope this is deliberately educational: it helps you inspect mappings,
compare representations, and build graph prototypes. It does **not** generate
validated production simulation topologies.

```python
cg = mol.coarse_grain("residue_com")
cg = mol.coarse_grain("residue_centroid")
cg = mol.coarse_grain("martini")
```

The result is still a `Molecule`, so it can be plotted, transformed, converted
to a graph, and analyzed.

## Built-in teaching mappings

### Residue centre of mass

`"residue_com"` collapses each residue to one bead at the mass-weighted centre
of all atoms in that residue:

```python
mol = ms.read("examples/data/1fqy.pdb")
cg = mol.coarse_grain("residue_com")

len(mol), len(cg)        # 1661 atoms -> 226 residue beads
cg.atom_names[:5]        # residue names carried as bead names
```

Mass weighting matters: a centre of mass is pulled toward heavier atoms, while a
centroid is the unweighted average of coordinates. Use `"residue_centroid"` when
you want the geometric centre instead:

```python
com = mol.coarse_grain("residue_com")
centroid = mol.coarse_grain("residue_centroid")
```

### Backbone/sidechain beads

`"martini"` is a simplified backbone/sidechain split inspired by Martini-style
coarse-graining:

```python
bb_sc = mol.coarse_grain("martini")
bb_sc.atom_names[:6]     # ['BB', 'SC', 'BB', 'SC', ...]
```

For each residue, backbone atoms (`N`, `CA`, `C`, `O`, `OXT`) become a `BB`
bead and non-hydrogen sidechain atoms become an `SC` bead when present. MolScope
then adds a simple bead graph: within-residue `BB-SC` bonds plus sequential
`BB-BB` links along each chain.

This is the useful concept to learn from Martini: represent groups of atoms as
interaction sites, preserve an interpretable molecular shape, and work at lower
resolution. Real Martini models also require bead types, bonded terms,
nonbonded parameters, charges, exclusions, validation against reference
atomistic/experimental behavior, and toolchain-specific topology files. MolScope
does not attempt those production steps.

## Custom residue mappings

```python
mapping = {"ALA": {"BB": ["N", "CA", "C", "O"], "SC": ["CB"]}}
cg = mol.coarse_grain(mapping)
```

## Custom index mappings

```python
cg = mol.coarse_grain(
    {"head": [0, 1, 2, 3], "tail": [4, 5, 6, 7]},
    bonds=[("head", "tail")],
)
```

Name-based bonds are intended for unique bead names. Repeated names such as
`BB` and `SC` are ambiguous across residues; use bead indices for those.

## Visualise the mapping

`plot_mapping` shows how the beads sit on top of the atoms they replace. Each
atom is coloured by the bead it was folded into, every bead is drawn as a large
translucent sphere at its position, thin lines join atoms to their bead, and the
CG bond network is drawn between beads. Atoms left unassigned appear as faint
grey crosses.

```python
import molscope as ms

fragment = ms.read("examples/data/1fqy.pdb").select(resid=(8, 12))
cg = fragment.coarse_grain("martini")

ms.plot_mapping(fragment, cg)     # or: cg.plot_mapping(fragment)
```

To compare mapping resolutions side by side, run:

```bash
uv run python examples/coarse_graining.py
```

Pass the structure the CG model was built from (same atom order). The
atom-to-bead lines are drawn automatically for small structures; toggle them
with `show_assignment=True/False`, and the bead legend appears when there are
few enough beads to stay readable (`max_legend`).

## Inspect the bead assignment

Every coarse-grained `Molecule` carries a structured report describing exactly
which atoms went into each bead:

```python
cg = mol.coarse_grain("martini")
report = cg.coarse_grain_report

print(report.coverage())          # "426 beads from 1661/1661 atoms"
print(report.n_beads, report.n_assigned, report.n_dropped)

first = report.beads[0]
print(first.name, first.resname, first.resid, first.chain)
print(first.atom_indices)         # source-atom indices, in order
print(first.atom_names)           # ["N", "CA", "C", "O"]
print(first.reduction)            # "centre of mass"
```

`print(cg.mapping_report())` formats the whole thing as text (beads, dropped
atoms, and bonds), and `cg.coarse_grain("...", return_report=True)` returns the
`(molecule, report)` pair directly.

## Export and reload a mapping

Save the mapping to JSON, reload it, and re-apply it to a structure. Because the
record stores per-bead atom indices, repeated bead names such as `BB`/`SC`
round-trip cleanly:

```python
ms.write_cg_mapping(cg, "mapping.json")   # or: cg.write_mapping("mapping.json")

record = ms.read_cg_mapping("mapping.json")
cg2 = ms.apply_cg_mapping(mol, record)    # rebuild on the same (or matching) structure
```

`cg_mapping_to_dict(cg)` returns the same record as a plain `dict` without
touching disk. For inspection in tools that read index files, write a
GROMACS-style `.ndx` with one group per bead (1-based atom serials):

```python
ms.write_cg_index(cg, "mapping.ndx")      # or: cg.write_index("mapping.ndx")
```

The bead `Molecule` itself still writes as ordinary coordinates with its CG
bonds preserved:

```python
ms.write_pdb(cg, "beads.pdb")             # CONECT records carry the bead bonds
```

## Mapping reports

```python
cg = mol.coarse_grain("martini")
print(cg.mapping_report())

cg, report = mol.coarse_grain(mapping, return_report=True)
```

## Limitations

MolScope is useful for interpretable coarse-graining prototypes, visual mapping
inspection, and graph/ML representations.

It does not:

- assign Martini bead types or force-field parameters,
- create angle, dihedral, nonbonded, charge or exclusion terms,
- build validated production simulation topologies,
- validate elastic networks, bead chemistry, or thermodynamic behavior,
- replace a Martini preparation workflow.

The `.ndx` and JSON exports describe a bead assignment for inspection and reuse;
they are not simulation-ready topology files.
