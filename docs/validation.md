# Scientific validation

MolScope is a lightweight teaching and prototyping toolkit, so validation is
not just "tests pass". For every scientific method, ask:

- What is the reference?
- What assumptions does the method make?
- Where does it fail?
- What tolerance is scientifically reasonable?

The validation suite is split into two tiers:

- **Tier 1 invariants** run everywhere and check mathematical or conservation
  truths that do not need an external tool.
- **Tier 2 reference comparisons** run when optional scientific tools are
  installed: MDAnalysis, RDKit, and `mkdssp`/`dssp`.

Run the full validation layer locally:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/validation -v -rs -s
```

The binding-site panel includes opt-in RCSB downloads. Run it explicitly with:

```bash
MOLSCOPE_RUN_REMOTE_PDB=1 uv run pytest tests/validation/test_binding_sites_ref.py
```

Install optional Python references with:

```bash
uv sync --extra validation
```

The secondary-structure reference additionally needs a system `mkdssp` or
`dssp` executable on `PATH`.

## Current panel scope

The current reference checks are deliberately small. They are best read as
targeted scientific smoke tests: `1fqy` exercises a mostly helical protein for
DSSP-style secondary structure, `1aml` exercises a compact NMR ensemble, `3ptb`
exercises the bundled binding-site path, and the RDKit checks cover a handful
of embedded small molecules. The opt-in remote binding-site panel adds `1stp`,
`1iep`, `3ert`, `1hsg`, `4hvp`, and `2br1` to catch ligand ambiguity,
multi-chain complexes, cofactors and larger inhibitors. That is useful for
catching regressions, but it is not yet a benchmark panel.

Future validation should expand these examples into a curated mini-panel:
helix-rich, beta-rich and mixed alpha/beta proteins for DSSP; several NMR
ensembles for alignment metrics; and a broader small-molecule chemistry set
covering rings, heteroatoms, charged/zwitterionic species, strained geometry
and known cases where distance-only bond perception should fail.

## Reference-tool checks

| Area | Reference | Validation file | Panel | Tolerance / threshold | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mass geometry | MDAnalysis | `tests/validation/test_geometry_ref.py` | `1fqy.pdb` | `radius_of_gyration` relative `1e-6`; center of mass absolute `1e-5`; inertia relative `1e-5` | Same formulas and same PDB coordinates should agree to floating-point precision. |
| Geometry primitives | MDAnalysis | `tests/validation/test_geometry_ref.py` | `1fqy.pdb` | distances relative `1e-5`; angles/dihedrals absolute `1e-4` degrees | Coordinate precision and degree conversion dominate error. |
| CA distance/contact maps | MDAnalysis | `tests/validation/test_geometry_ref.py` | `1fqy.pdb` alpha carbons | distance matrix absolute `1e-5`; contact pairs exact at 8 A | Contact-map logic should match an independent distance-threshold implementation. |
| Ensemble RMSF/RMSD | MDAnalysis | `tests/validation/test_geometry_ref.py` | `1aml.pdb` NMR ensemble | RMSF absolute `1e-3`; Kabsch RMSD absolute `1e-4` | Alignment and trajectory APIs differ slightly, but biologically meaningful values should agree tightly. |
| Distance bond perception | RDKit topology | `tests/validation/test_bonds_ref.py` | RDKit-embedded small molecules | bond precision and recall each `>= 0.98` | Geometry-only bond perception is expected to recover clean small-molecule topologies, with a small margin for future panel expansion. |
| Chemical features | RDKit atom/bond APIs | `tests/validation/test_chem_ref.py` | Aromatic, heteroatom and charged small molecules | formal charges and aromatic flags exact; bond orders exact within `1e-12` | MolScope delegates optional chemical perception to RDKit, so direct RDKit arrays are the reference. |
| RDKit descriptors | RDKit descriptor APIs | `tests/validation/test_chem_ref.py` | Same chemistry panel | selected scalar descriptors relative/absolute `1e-12` | Descriptor wrappers should not alter RDKit descriptor values. |
| Secondary structure | `mkdssp` / `dssp` | `tests/validation/test_dssp_ref.py` | `1fqy.pdb` | 3-state helix/strand/coil agreement `>= 0.95`; helix fraction within `0.15` | MolScope's DSSP is simplified and educational, so reduced-state agreement is the honest target rather than byte-for-byte 8-state equality. |
| Binding sites | RCSB structures with HETATM ligands | `tests/validation/test_binding_sites_ref.py` | `3ptb`; opt-in remote panel `1stp`, `1iep`, `3ert`, `1hsg`, `4hvp`, `2br1` | residue records and `pocket-basic` descriptors finite and internally consistent | Real protein-ligand files expose ambiguity, multi-chain sites, cofactors, ions and larger inhibitors better than synthetic fixtures. |

## Invariant checks

| Area | Validation file | Assertion | Tolerance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rigid-body alignment | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | Kabsch alignment recovers a known rotation/translation | RMSD `< 1e-9` |
| Self RMSD | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | A structure aligned to itself has zero RMSD | RMSD `< 1e-12` |
| Geometry primitives | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | Euclidean distances, right angles, planar torsions | Exact or near machine precision |
| Radius of gyration | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | Uniform shell has radius of gyration equal to shell radius | Absolute `< 1e-3` |
| Coarse-graining | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | Residue COM and centroid beads equal direct reductions of source atoms | Absolute `< 1e-9` |
| Contact maps | `tests/validation/test_invariants.py` | Atom contact map equals brute-force all-pairs threshold | Exact matrix equality |

## Assumptions and failure modes

| Method | Key assumptions | Expected failure modes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Geometric bonds | Clean 3D coordinates, normal covalent distances, standard elements | Missing/extra bonds for strained structures, metals, unusual valence, bad coordinates, or raw PDB files without explicit chemistry. |
| RDKit chemical features | Explicit bond orders/formal charges or a geometry whose inferred single-bond graph RDKit can sanitize | Sanitization errors for inconsistent valence or missing bond-order chemistry; aromaticity depends on RDKit's model and version. |
| Contact maps | Static coordinates and a chosen distance cutoff/method (`ca`, `com`, or `min`) | Different cutoffs or representative atoms change the result; dense atom maps are `O(N^2)`. |
| Simplified DSSP | Complete protein backbone atoms (`N`, `CA`, `C`, `O`) and standard residue ordering | Not canonical `mkdssp`; strand-rich or edge-case folds can disagree more than helical examples; bare XYZ input is insufficient. |
| Coarse-graining | Beads are coordinate reductions and simple bead graphs for inspection | No force-field parameters, charges, exclusions, elastic networks, or validation of simulation behavior. |

## Updating validation

When adding a scientific feature, add at least one of:

- an invariant test if the expected behavior follows from math or conservation,
- a reference-tool comparison if a credible external implementation exists,
- a limitations-table row if the method is intentionally approximate.

Prefer tight tolerances when two implementations should be numerically
equivalent. Use looser, justified thresholds only when the method is explicitly
approximate, as with simplified DSSP.
