"""Lightweight molecular coordinate workflows for descriptors, graphs, and CG beads.

molscope reads ``.xyz``, ``.pdb``, ``.cif`` and ``.sdf`` files (optionally
gzip-compressed) and turns static structures into three main outputs:
descriptor tables, molecular graphs for machine learning, and coarse-grained
bead representations.

Core workflows
--------------
- **PDB to descriptors**: fixed-width structural and optional RDKit-backed
  feature tables (:func:`descriptors`, :func:`featurize_many`).
- **PDB to graph/GNN**: atom/bond and residue-contact graphs for NetworkX,
  PyTorch Geometric and DGL (:class:`MolecularGraph`,
  :class:`ResidueContactGraph`).
- **PDB to coarse-grained beads**: residue, simplified Martini-style, custom,
  and virtual-site bead representations (:mod:`molscope.coarsegrain`).

Supporting capabilities include readers/writers, RCSB fetching, mmCIF
validation, selections, geometry, contact maps, simplified DSSP, ensemble
summaries, Matplotlib/py3Dmol visualization, and CLI automation.

Examples
--------
>>> import molscope as ms
>>> mol = ms.read("structure.pdb")     # parser chosen from the extension
>>> mol = ms.fetch("1fqy")             # ...or download straight from RCSB by id
>>> print(mol.summary())               # atoms, formula, chains, bounding box
>>> ca = mol.alpha_carbons()           # select the C-alpha atoms
>>> mol.plot(color_by="chain")         # render in 3D

>>> g = mol.to_graph()                 # molecular graph for ML, no extra deps
>>> cg = mol.coarse_grain("residue_com")   # one bead per residue
